### About
Hi! My name is Kirill! 👋
I am a *backend developer / Team lead* currently working in [Smenateam](https://github.com/smenateam)

I specialize in researching new technologies and aproaches, which I implement in new projects:
- Implemented GraphQL API using Django Graphene, which was as an MVP of this technology, bringing the best practices for future development
- Developed the autotest MVP application using Playwright library, which was used as the base for autotest development
- Developed automated pipeline for running autotests using Docker, CircleCi and a bit of python scripts, by which we have automatically running autotests on a remote machine

My programming stack contains `Python` and `Typescript` languages. I also master `Golang` for fun and future profit

The common tasks I deal with contain both development and operations stack: 
* Building web-applications using `Django REST`, `Django Graphene` (GraphQL) or `Flask` frameworks
* Operating relational and non-relational data storages
     * `MariaDB`🌊
     * `Postgres`🐘
     * `Elasticsearch`🔎
     * `Redis` 🟥
* Deploying applications using `ansible playbooks` and `docker`
* Building automated testing/deployment pipeline using `circleci`
* linux shell, ssh, scp, tmux, vim, etc.. 🖥️
