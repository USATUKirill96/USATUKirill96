### About me
Hi! My name is Kirill! 👋
I am a backend developer currently working in [Smenateam](https://github.com/smenateam)
My programming stack is made of `Python`, `Elixir` and `Javascript/Typescript` languages

My common tasks contain both development and ops stack: 

* building web-applications using `Django` or `Flask` frameworks
* operating relational and non-relational data storages
     * `MariaDB`🌊
     * `Postgres`🐘
     * `Elasticsearch`🔎
* using `Redis` 🟥 for cache, transactions and massaging
* API protocols: `REST`, `GraphQL`
* deploying using `ansible playbooks` and `docker`. 🇦
* linux shell, ssh, scp 🖥️

I am interested in studying *functional programming, DDD, clean architecture.*

### My repos:

##### [Django RabbitMQ](https://github.com/USATUKirill96/rabbitMQ)
🐍 My educating project where I integrated `rabbitMQ` into `django` project splitting it into microservices

##### [Cat food shop microservice](https://github.com/USATUKirill96/cat_food_orders)

##### [Atol mock server](https://github.com/USATUKirill96/atol_mock_server)
⚗️ Mock-server built on `Elixir`. Allows developers work on web-applications without necessity of buying actual Atol device. Currently used by Smenateam developers

##### [Slack-YT-threads bot](https://github.com/USATUKirill96/Slack-YT-threads)
⚗️ The goal of this app is to attach slack conversations to YouTrack issues. I used `docker` container to run the application and `ansible-playbooks` to deploy it. Currently used by Smenateam
